This is basic kernel modules were i am creating different different modules. 
1: hello.c    (this is sinple hello world progrem)
2: k_prob.c   (k_prob is use for debug system call.)
3: sct.c      (in this module we hook kill sys call and replace with newkill)

step 1: install all kernel headers (we can't use user space headers in kernel mode) 
(headers path => /usr/include)

step 2: make

step 3: sudo insmode file_name.ko    (install module in kernel space)(.ko represent kernel object file)
step 4: lsmod | grep file_name (list all module     :path => /proc/module) 
step 5: sudo dmesg    (you can check kernel logs)
step 6: sudo rmmod file_name  (remove module from kernel space)


Note : if secure boot is on in your machine then you need to off secure boot so you can run these 
       module without signe.
